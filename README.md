# Console advanced calculator

This console calculator was made by Victor Galkevich and Fyodor Zakharevich, we did a nice work and the calculator's functions are not based on "cmath" library,
every method was made by us using taylor series and NONE of them using "cmath". There are 2 modes: engineering, programming. Each of them has some special functions and 
they actually are:
1) addition
2) subtraction
3) multiplication
4) division
5) tan, ctg, sin, cos
6) atan, actg, asin, acos
7) all the functions from the 5th point but hyperbolic
8) modulo, upperBorder, lowerBorder
9) toHex, toBin, toOct
10) bitwise shifts
11) logA(x), ln(x), lg(x)
12) exp
13) factorial
14) many sort functions
15) complex numbers
16) tests
All of them u can use in our calculator.
Our calculator works with long strokes of mathematical expressions.
